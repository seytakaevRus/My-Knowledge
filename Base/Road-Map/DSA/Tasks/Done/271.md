## Описание

Разработать алгоритм, который будет кодировать массив строк в строку. Эту строку затем нужно будет декодировать в массив строк обратно.

`Машина 1` (отправитель) имеет функцию:

```
string encode(vector<string> strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded_string;
}
```

`Машина 2` (получатель) имеет функцию:

```
vector<string> decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}
```

`Машина 1` делает:

```
string encoded_string = encode(strs);
```

`Машина 2` делает:

```
vector<string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);
```

`strs2` в `Машина 2` должен быть таким же, как и `strs` в `Машина 1`. Нужно реализовать методы `encode` и `decode`.

Строки могут содержать любые возможные символы из `256` допустимых символов `ASCII`. Алгоритм должен быть достаточно обобщенным, чтобы работать с любыми возможными символами.

Алгоритм не должен хранить и извлекать какие-то данные во вне функций.

Также нельзя полагаться на библиотечные методы такие как `eval` или другие методы сериализации. Нужно создать свой алгоритм кодирования/декодирования.

---
## Ограничения

- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` содержит любые возможные символы из `256` валидных `ASCII` символов.

## Пример 1

### Входные данные

```
dummy_input = ["Hello","World"]
```
### Выходные данные

```
["Hello","World"]
```
### Объяснение

```
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);
```

---
## Пример 2

### Входные данные

```
dummy_input = [""]
```
### Выходные данные

```
[""]
```

## Решение 1

Метод `encode` превращает из массив строк `["abc", "cdf"]` в строку `3#abc3#cdf`, где `3` - количество символов в слове, а `#` - разделительный знак, который говорит, что дальше идет строка определенной длины.

Такой формат был выбран, потому что при использовании только числа или только разделительного знака нельзя было бы однозначно декодировать. К примеру, элемент `3aab5` превращается в `53aab5` и становится непонятно, где длина слова `5`, `3` или `53`. Также и с `#`, элемент `#aab#` превращается в `##aab#` и становится невозможно понять, где нужное слово.

Метод `decode` представляет из себя цикл, который посимвольно ищет символ `#`, параллельно собирая число, которое всегда будет стоять перед `#`. При нахождении такого символа вычисляется индекс, где заканчивается слово, он вычисляется как индекс, где начинается слово (это следующий символ за `#`) плюс значения числа, которые было собрано до нахождение символа `#`. Далее `index` перемещается на индекс конца текущего слова.

```typescript
class Codec {
  // time complexity O(n)
  // space complexity O(n)
  encode(strs: string[]): string {
    let encoded = "";

    for (const str of strs) {
      encoded += `${str.length}#${str}`;
    }

    return encoded;
  }

  // time complexity O(n)
  // space complexity O(n)
  decode(str: string): string[] {
    const decoded: string[] = [];

    let index = 0;
    let numberString = '';

    for (; index < str.length; ) {
      if (str[index] === "#") {
        const startWord = index + 1;
        const endWord = startWord + Number(numberString);
        const decodedString = str.slice(startWord, endWord);

        decoded.push(decodedString);

        index = endWord;
      } else {
        numberString += str[index];

        index += 1;
      }
    }

    return decoded;
  }
}
```
